This is an ecommerce website project.

You can use my code if you want to. If you want to change some code or add it, fork and send request.

There are many things that can be better about styling. But as the backend code, it can be used in real time (considering you have Stripe account to accept actual payments).

I am open to any suggestions and improvements.

I will be adding these below:

1- Cancel order, cancel refund request functions to admin functions. I postponed it to the end because I didn't want to deal with test orders just to cancel them at that point.

2- Notify customer by email when order is being prepared, shipped, delivered, if their return request is accepted or denied, if order is cancelled.
