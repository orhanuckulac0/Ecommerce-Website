This is an ecommerce website project.
You can use my code if you want to. If you want to change some code or add it, fork and send request.
There are many things that can be better about styling. But as the backend code, it can be used in real time (considering you have Stripe account to accept actual payments).
I am open to any suggestions and improvements.
